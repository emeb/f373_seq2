# f373_seq2 software
C code for a 3-channel CV + Gate step sequencer for Eurorack based on the
STM32F373CCT6 processor.

This project requires the following tools

* make

* Gnu ARM Embedded GCC - you may need to tweak the Makefile to point to your
installation. I used version 7-2018-q2-update.

* Open OCD - for flashing and debugging. I used version 0.10.0+dev-00409-g7b94ae9
